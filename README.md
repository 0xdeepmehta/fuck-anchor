# Ah Fuck Anchor

I was tired of looking up Anchor errors.

```bash
fuck <error_hex_code>
```

Example:

```bash
$ fuck 0xbc0
> Anchor Program
3008 | InvalidProgramId: Program ID was not as expected
```

## Installation ðŸ›  
- ```cargo build --release```
- Now put `$PWD/target/release/fuck` in your PATH
